# Covi-Org
Covi Org is a Power App that provides you the ability to view trends and tracker your employees status and alert co-workers in case of emergency. It can help you collect vaccination status and other details in just click of a button through Outlook Actionable Message. Send periodic notification to all the unvaccinated employees to update their status (configurable). The most important feature is generating near real-time graphs with the data from Cosmos DB.
